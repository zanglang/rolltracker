RollTracker Lite is an *extremely small* addon used for keeping track of `/rolls`, and especially useful for raid leaders when managing loot.

**Currently [accepting localizations](http://www.wowace.com/projects/rolltracker/localization/) for Latin American Spanish and Korean! [File a ticket](http://www.wowace.com/projects/rolltracker/create-ticket/) if you need help doing so.**

**There used to be a bug with the German client. If you're using it, please test out [v0.4-beta](http://www.wowace.com/addons/rolltracker/files/26-v0-4-beta) and PM/comment if it works/doesn't work, thanks. :)**

## Features

* Sort /rolls
* Highlight rerolls, ties and non-standard ranges

* `/rolltracker` or `/rt` to manually display the tracker
* `/rolltracker clear` to manually clear all rolls

## Credits

RollTracker Lite was rewritten from scratch based on an old pre-WOTLK addon of the same name, originally by Coth of Gilneas and Morodan of Khadgar, and currently maintained by Eryne at http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/rolltracker2.
